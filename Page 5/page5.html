This site is meant to be a of what I do to relax 

Golden Hour- I call this part of the site ‘golden hour’ to give the user a chance to virtually experience the sunset and possibly take a moment and reflect on their thoughts by scrolling thru calming images. The use of two people in the middle is to visually represent the romance of watching the sunset. The user has the option of dragging and separate the couple to counter relationship anxiety. This portion of the site is inspired by the times I watched the sunset to reflect on my thoughts and feelings.


Cloud Nine- I play a lot of calming music when i sleep and I use certain sites like rainymood to fall asleep to. So “ Cloud Nine”  is just a simple calming part of the site where users can listen to this playlist to help people fall asleep to or just chill out to with a little part of a poem I wrote.

Sunlight- I tried motivating myself on watching the sunset and watching the sunrise for a week just to see if it betters my mental health and it did! Because not only it gave me time to reflect on life and inspire me to draw more, it fixed my sleeping schedule because I'd sleep early and wake up early in anticipation to watch the sunrise to film it or just chill out in my room and relax before going to class.
